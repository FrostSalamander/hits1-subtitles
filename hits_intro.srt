1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,860
Abductions on Bedford Road this time. You're certain?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,000
Upon my word as a thief, Captain.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,500
They's taking beggars and tramps right off the streets, just like you said.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,900
Then I fear the worst Jacobs,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,400
for only men of influence might sanction such blatant mischief.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,400
and the captors were taken to an inn you say?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Somewhere thereabouts, The Hare in the Snare they calls it, and that's where I've gone with my infestation.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Investigation.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,900
That's what I said!

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Ah, anyway, I've taken a room at the inn, gonna start sniffing about.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,300
No, I shall not endanger you any further.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,099
These abductions no doubt serve the interests of a greater corruption,

13
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:50,800
or else I'd not have been ordered to turn a blind eye.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,900
If the City watch is in on it, then you need my help.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
And you promised me the job, Captain.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,600
(sighs) Sneaking about the inn will place you in great danger, Jacobs.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm a thief. Sneakin's the one thing I'm almost good at.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,600
I don't like it, but I am left with few choices.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
My hands are tied, and I suppose you have proven your worth.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,900
That's right. And if I fail, you need only find my old mate at this address.

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,900
He's a right fox him, he'll get it done.

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,900
And he's got a special talent for all of them things what you shall not approve of.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Then let us hope I have no need of his talents.

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,900
Paying one of you is quite enough.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,900
Well, I better head back before they close for the night.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,900
And don't you worry, Captain. I'll find out what's going on

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,420
and they will never suspect a thing.

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,900
A letter at this hour.

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,340
Curious.
