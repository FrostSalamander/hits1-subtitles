1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,640
Beggars and street dwellers rounded up like cattle.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,400
And the inn as a staging point run by the lackeys of someone they call 'P'.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:19,599
Poor Jacobs had no idea what he was walking into, and they made him pay for it.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,639
At least he's alive, so there's still a chance I can get him back.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,200
But first I need to know what I'm walking into, and it seems I can rely on the good captain to find out.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,200
And the former Lieutenant Hales, what is she doing mixed up in all this?

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,480
No wonder Jacobs never stood a chance, and I suspect I'll be crossing paths with her again real soon.
